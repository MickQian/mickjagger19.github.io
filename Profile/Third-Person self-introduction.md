Qian Chengliang(English name as Mick) is a person, pursuiting jobs of creativity and crave for learning and exploring new technologies and skills.

Graduated as a bachelor in Computer Sciende at ZJU(Zhejiang University), his acedemic record is among the top 20% in CS College, 10% in the last two years, which proves his ability to learn. At school, he interns at a big tech company in china for 2 months, and act as a major contributor of a transpiler project, which translates java code to scala, and beats the performance of the most competitors at that time.

And because of that expierence, he found that a lot can be learnt from work, so he joined that company after graduating. In the two years of working there, he was a major contributor to some important projects, say, for example, an IDE written in Rust developed from scratch. He built the text-editor on his own, which is the essential part of the IDE, and its performance outbeats some of the most popular editors. Learning from the best-practice of the design of them, he put a lot of work to make the editor light and responsive, by exploiting the most suitable data structure and the advantage of Rust as a programming language.

But his real interst may lay elsewhere.
