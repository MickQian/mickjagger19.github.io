guitar playlist

Electric

comfortably numb

mary had a little lamb

superstition

sultans of swing

for you blue

something

franklinâ€™s tower

Hey joe

Nobody knows you

  

another brick in the wall

get back

wait until tomorrow

  

roundabout

little wing

pride and joy

texas flood

sweet home chicago

Acoustic

before you accuse

layla

for you blue

while my guitar gently weeps

lonely stranger

pink moon
