### Experience 
#### Bad Service
* indifference, impatience
* At an Italian restaurant where I had planned to take my then-girlfriend on our first date. It was two years ago and we were both excited about the night.
* Once seated, the waiter took a long time to take our orders, despite the restaurant not being particularly busy.
* When our food finally arrived, I was in huge shock. I love Italian food and know how to cook some dishes myself, but the Carbonara presented to me was the worst I even seen. **Salty**, burnt **and** raw at the same time. Also, my pasta was lukewarm.
* We don't leave plenty of time for the problem to be solved, as we immediately paid our bill and left with disappointment. 
* ruined my day
* I will never enter that restaurant again, I swear to god.

#### With a young child | Party
* an occasion when I spent time with a young child. 
* This happened at my colleague's son's birthday party. I decided to bring a guitar as a gift, knowing the child's interest in music.
* We ended up spending the entire afternoon together, where I taught him some basic guitar chords and picking technique.
* By the end of the day, he was able to strum a few simple songs including twinkle twinkle little star. Seeing his sense of achievement and the joy on his face was truly rewarding. 
* **Not only did he feel satisfied, I also experience a great sense of fulfillment by teaching others,  sparking a new passion in a young mind.**
#### Meals
One of the most unusual meals I've ever had holds significant meaning to me. I can't recall the exact date, but it was approximately three years ago, **shortly after my college graduation**. It happened on a Friday night when my then-girlfriend took me to a local Italian restaurant. 

Up until that point, I had never ventured into the realm of exotic cuisines, so **this encounter with Italian food** marked a **novel** experience for me. I was captivated by the rich flavors and unique ingredients that characterized the dishes in this restaurant. I **particularly enjoyed** the Margherita pizza and Carbonara; they remain my favorites to this day.

What made this meal unusual, and indeed transformative, was that **it opened the door for me to explore cooking on my own**. This dining experience ignited a culinary curiosity in me that I had not known before, and it continues to influence my food choices and cooking ventures.
#### Speech
* music about surf rock
* I was then a sophomore student and I was in a school club, which is basically people with shared interests towards arts. **We hold salon occasionally.**

* but satisfied, self-expression

#### Tech difficult to use
* though I work in tech industry, I always find it hard to use sports camera
* go pro

* Unfortunately, several problems occurred. I find it hard to switch mode, fix and lost some part
#### Book

#### Ads don't like
I really enjoy watching advertisements, as some are very creative and attractive. 
However, there is one advertisement I dislike that I’ve seen on television about a toilet cleaner. A celebrity visit randomly picked homes and asks the owner if the toilet is clean or not. Everyone replies that their toilets are clean, but then the celebrity zooms in with their camera and reveals some dirt. They proceed to clean the toilet with a new liquid, making it sparkle.
Seeing this ad during mealtime is disgusting and annoying, sometimes even making me feel nauseous.

cheesy

#### Useful ad
#### Lost | False information
* It happened several months ago when my friend and I are on the way to a local music festival with my friend
* The concerted was supposed to start in the afternoon, so We took a cab to the location described on the ticket at noon, but it was a deserted place which turned out to be a used power plant
* Unable to find on the map, so we had to walk aimlessly, hoping to find someone to help
* Luckily, it was close to the actual location. We managed to get close step by step, by following the sound made by amplifiers.
* Although I was pretty frustrated and annoyed by the false information provided by the organizer, but finally found it by ourselves has solved the problem

#### Invention
* AirPods, which is a bluetooth headphone
* It's a headphone/noise isolator
* I love it for its convenience, without the bothering of the line.
* Also, as a music lover, the denoise feature ensure me enjoying music in a undisturbed way, disconnecting me from the noise.
* Pretty easy to use, you just put the headphones on the ears, than they will be automatically connected with apple devices



Looking back, I think it reflects the different mindsets of the young generation and their parents in China.
It's probably due to the hardships the parents experienced in the past.
They should enjoy life like, a bit, after working hard

#### Art
**The piece of work that I like the most is** Sunflowers by Vincent Van Gogh. 
I first saw it when I went to a local museum .In fact, it was a replica. **No sooner had I seen it than I fell** in love with it. Only **when I arrived in Amsterdam did I learn**the full story of Van Gogh’s life. 
**Rarely had I seen** anything as striking and distinctive. **What I love about it** is the colour
