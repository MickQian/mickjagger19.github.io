#### Noisy

I would like to talk about a night bar/Mexican restaurant near my college. It was **a local landmark**  地标 actually, located on the street next to our campus. People would go there to **relieve stress and anxiety from school**, or celebrate the end of a season. But my last visit there proved me wrong.

Before my friend and I entered the bar, I could already hear the loud sound from the stereos which played **the catchy and cheesy music**. **The tone quality** was rather awful so all I heard was ==**high pitch== of sound** rather than nice and **gentle melodies**.  Besides, after sitting down at a small table, there are too many people talking in a loud voice that I can hardly here my friend was saying. 

Mention food: 
Though the food there was tasty, I love the Fajita and Mojito, the atmosphere in the bar **was too awful to endure**.

It is a little bit off the beaten track but a serene wonderland surrounded by great scenic beauty 美景 and magnificent landscapes 壮丽风景.==

#### Meals
One of the most unusual meals I've ever had holds significant meaning to me. I can't recall the exact date, but it was approximately three years ago, **shortly after my college graduation**. It happened on a Friday night when my then-girlfriend took me to a local Italian restaurant. 

Up until that point, I had never ventured into the realm of exotic cuisines, so **this encounter with Italian food** marked a **novel** experience for me. I was captivated by the rich flavors and unique ingredients that characterized the dishes in this restaurant. I **particularly enjoyed** the Margherita pizza and Carbonara; they remain my favorites to this day.

What made this meal unusual, and indeed transformative, was that **it opened the door for me to explore cooking on my own**. This dining experience ignited a culinary curiosity in me that I had not known before, and it continues to influence my food choices and cooking ventures.
#### Speech
* music about surf rock
* I was then a sophomore student and I was in a school club, which is basically people with shared interests towards arts. **We hold salon occasionally.**
* To prepare for the speech, keynote, transcript, and visual aids are required. It took me several weeks to organize.
* As for the speech, not so many people, great interaction with the audience. We have a nice conversation.
* but satisfied, self-expression
#### Game played 
As a child, I haven't participated in many games. However, I can recall vividly about roller-skating in the playground of my community 
* Speaking of roller-skating, it's basically skating, but on the **cement roads**. Also, it requires special equipment/appliance, too.
* Usually, after dinner, some of my friends and I would gather at the playground, skating in circle. Sometimes we would had a informal competition, the first one to complete certain laps would be the Champion. Sometimes we slipped and hurt our knees, so later we had our kneecap on.
* Though I was really good at it, as I was a little afraid of skating at a high speed, I really enjoyed the happiness and tension from this game.




#### Tech difficult to use
* though I work in tech industry, I always find it hard to use sports camera
* go pro
* Plan was to stick it to the top my guitar for first-perspective video. 
* At first I thought It would be easy. I mean, what's so hard about recording a video? But the **reality** proved me wrong.
* Unfortunately, several problems occurred. **I find it hard to switch mode, fix and lost some part**. Also, the videos it recorded are separated into small pieces, because of the memory limit
* I think I won't use any sports camera currently, I'll use smartphones instead





#### Book
* As many others might have say, the novel I enjoy the most is Harry Potter
* Harry Potter basically talk about how a boy, Harry Potter grow up with his friends, facing countless challenges, fighting numerous Death Eaters,  and finally beat Voldemort, the biggest villain in the book.
* When I was I child, I couldn't recall how many times I imagine myself, waving my **wand**, **chanting** a spell, fighting death eaters
* The **courage** and **perseverance** has encouraged me to **take the same attitude towards obstacles** I encountered in my life

#### Ads don't like
I really enjoy watching advertisements, as some are very creative and attractive. 
However, there is one advertisement I dislike that I’ve seen on television about a toilet cleaner. 
A celebrity visit randomly picked homes and asks the owner if the toilet is clean or not. **Everyone** replies that their toilets are clean, but then the celebrity **zooms** in with their camera and **reveals** some dirt. They **proceed** to clean the toilet with a new **liquid**, making it **sparkle**.
Seeing this ad during mealtime is **disgusting** and **annoying**, sometimes even making me feel nauseous.

cheesy

#### Useful ad
To be honest, I don’t watch a lot of television/ if I'm honest,  but I do watch some TV episodes on Stream Media. 
I remember one time I was watching a  popular music TV show, and it's basically several bands competing with each others. In the middle of the show, an ad **popped out**. Now usually, I would be annoyed by ads, but it was about an electric guitar. I saw a musician playing **beautiful notes** with this guitar, and it **haunted** me throughout the rest of the show. And I was not aware of what happened in that show.
After the commercial ended, I immediately bought one on online shop. And I was happy and satistied about the guitar. Throughout the time, it has totally proved that it **worth the price**, and looking back,  I'm thankful for that encounter with the ad.


#### Lost | False information
* It happened several months ago when my friend and I are on the way to a local music festival
* The concerted was supposed to start in the afternoon, so we took a cab to the location described **on the ticket** at noon, but it was a deserted place which turned out to be a used power plant
* Unable to find on the map, so we had to walk **aimlessly**, hoping to find someone to help
* Luckily, it was close to the actual location. We managed to get close step by step, by following the sound made by stereos.
* Although I was pretty **frustrated** and **annoyed** by the false information provided by the organizer, but finally found it by ourselves has solved the problem

##### Information

For one, **it's much easier to ignore or overlook an email, compared to a phone call**. **Urgency and tone of voice** are also lost within emails. 
Emails can also consume valuable time with **back-and-forth messages** that could have been handled with a quick phone conversation.
However, when it comes to further recording and details, email is a better option.
Phones ensure real-time synchronized communication,

#### Proud
* So about 3 years ago, my company is holding a competition called "Hackathon". It's basically a group of people gathering together, solving an issue within 48 hours or so. Later, all the work will be **evaluated** by some judges.
* Some of my colleagues call out me to join their team. Why not?
* But we encountered countless issues, as we had no experience participating in any hackathon before. One of the major problem was, we found ourselves working on **separated** computers, so **information sharing** was a struggle. I immediately suggested we started the "**collaborated development**" feature on our computers. As a result, the efficient was doubled.
* After working **tirelessly** on the issue for several days, We were thrilled and overwhelmed to **receive** an honorable mention for that competition, for the competition had been fierce. 
* Looking back, we were proud that we managed to solve a problem **outside our area of expertise** and the perseverance we had put in.



#### Invention
* AirPods, which is a bluetooth headphone
* It's a headphone/noise isolator
* I love it for its convenience, without the bothering of the line.
* Also, as a music lover, the denoise feature ensure me enjoying music in a undisturbed way, disconnecting me from the noise.
* Pretty easy to use, you just put the headphones on the ears, than they will be automatically connected with apple devices



Looking back, I think it reflects the different mindsets of the young generation and their parents in China.
It's probably due to the hardships the parents experienced in the past.
They should enjoy life like, a bit, after working hard

#### Art
post-impressionist style
**The piece of work that I like the most is** "The Starry Night" by brilliant Vincent Van Gogh. 

I first encountered “The Starry Night” during a school trip to a local [Museum](https://ieltsrewind.com/describe-a-museum-you-have-visited-and-liked/) . Unfortunately, it was merely a replica, but that didn't affect the presentation of that artwork.

As I was wondering in the museum a painting with its **vibrant colors and unique style** stood out among the other artworks.
So I approached to take a closer look at it.

from the later research I did, painted in 1889 in a mental hospital, it **depicts an image** of a night sky filled with **swirling** & chaotic stars, overlooking a quaint 古色古香 town. The night sky could be seen as a representation of his inner feelings and emotional state at that time. 
![[Pasted image 20230930103128.png]]

**I was also surprised to find that** one of my favorite songs, "Vincent"by Don Mclean, starts with the lyric "Starry Starry night",  serves as a tribute to Van Gogh.

Resonate & dark times & adversity: I find most fascinating about “The Starry Night” is how it resonates with me on an emotional level. It serves as a **reminder** that **beauty can be found even in dark times**, and that ==creativity can flourish **amidst adversity 逆境**==.

It serves as an inspiration, **reminding** us of the power of perseverance and the unlimited potential of human [creativity](https://ieltsrewind.com/describe-a-creative-person-whose-work-you-admire/).

Yes, there’s no denying that modernization and changing lifestyles have had an impact on traditional festivals.

So basically, it's the way of the celebration that is changing, not the festivals themselves.
