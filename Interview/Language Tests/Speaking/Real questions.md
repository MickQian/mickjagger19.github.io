### Robots

Using robots in agriculture or production is a smart choice, being faster, cheaper than some sophisticated workers. However, robots don't know how to learn, so they won't replace human, at least in the near future.

#### Jobs
Robots can easily replace workers that involve mechanical repotition or physical actions, such as cleaners, typewriters, drivers, plumbers. On the other hand, jobs require empathy can't be replaced by robots, for instance, teachers.

He never seems annoyed or refuse to help, 

Thanks to his help, we managed to produce our original song and perform in local concerns, which turned out to be quite successful.

One job I find particularly interesting is being a guitarist in a band.

The most exciting aspect of this job is the opportunity to perform all around the world. This global exposure allows me to experience a **variety of cultures, meet diverse people**. It's an incredible way to expand one's horizons and **gain a deeper understanding** of the world.
Also, I get to meet different musicians around the world. **Hopefully I can draw some inspirations and learn from them.**

### Public Figure
* successful
* popular

I'like to talk about a legendary figure in the music world, David Bowie, who is widely recognized for his distinctive voice, eclectic musical style, and innovative approach to artistry. He's an intriguing character because of his constant reinvention and his ability to blend various musical genres, including rock, pop, electronic, and experimental music.

He's a man with great charm and charisma, presenting a unisex vibe.

Not only does he has an appealing appearance, but he also has a beautiful voice, perfect for the mysterious theme of his songs.

Bowie's popularity stems from his unique persona and his groundbreaking music. He created numerous iconic albums like "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" and "Heroes", which have influenced countless musicians and left a lasting impact on the music industry. His alter ego, Ziggy Stardust, a flamboyant and androgynous extraterrestrial being, challenged societal norms and contributed to his fame.

What made Bowie particularly helpful was his openness to change and his courage to push boundaries. He was unafraid to experiment with different styles and personas, opening the door for future artists to explore their identities and creativity without fear of judgment. His influence extends beyond music to fashion, film, and visual art, making him an enduring cultural icon. David Bowie's legacy continues to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide.

### Clothes

#### Wear most often 
I prefer wearing clothes of high quality, with a little bit **vintage** vibe, and also they are better to be unisex 

I adhere to the principle of/choose quality over quantity.

* For the style, It's a Type-II Trucker jacket, which is a classic model. It features classical American postwar retro style 
* Denim Cloth is my favorite material for a jacket, I like the rigid nature of it
* Apart from the material, I'm obsessed with denim blue, it encapsulates both masculinity and energy
* Since it's quite thick, I wear them only in Autumn and Spring, about once a weak

#### Brand
As a big fan of Margaret Howell, my wardrobe mainly features her classic pieces.

Personally, I'm fond of neutral tones, such as blacks, white, brown and gray, which aligns with the tone in Howell's collection. I find these colors low-profile, **versatile** and easy to pair. Besides, the high-quality choice of the material also make it practical and endurable.

**Furthermore, Howell's clothes allow me to express myself without being confined to traditional gender norms, as they seamlessly blend masculinity and femininity, creating a unisex appeal.**

It's the **minimalist**, **quality** and **versatility** of Howell's clothes that attract me.

### Place
#### Distant places I want to go in the future
LiverPool, United Kingdown
* Hometown of the The Beatles & Merceybeat, which is a genre of music.

#### Relax | Apartment

#### Store
* a new guitar flagship shop, **featuring** my favorite guitar brand
* It sells a variety of guitars, as well as related accessories including guitar amp, pick, string and straps
* Based on my observation there, most of the customers are musicians or guitar players. They came for better guitars or back-up ones. Random walkers will occasionally come in, out of curiosity.
* With the rising of music industry and growing level of musical aesthetics among people, I believe more and more people will have their own guitars, making this shop **thrive in business**


#### Park
* xianghu, not far from where I live

#### Noisy
I would like to talk about a night bar/mexical restaurant near my college. It was **a local landmark**  地标 actually, located on the street next to our campus. People would go there to relieve stress and anxiety from school,  or celebrate the end of a season. But my last visit there proved me wrong.

Before my friend and I entered the bar, I could already hear the loud sound from the stereos which played **the catchy and cheesy music**. The tone quality was rather awful so all I heard was **high pitch of soun**d rather than nice and **gentle melodies**.  Besides, after sitting down at a small table, there're too many people talking in a loud voice that I can hardly here my friend was saying. 

Though the food there was tasty, I love the Fajita and Mojito, the atmosphere in the bar **was too awful to endure**. I was expecting a quiet listening experience but everything was out of my imagination. **People were raising their voice as the background music was overwhelming**, which made the place all the more **unbearable**.

unbearable


#### Pollution
* during a visit to my hometown 2 years ago, when I was on a vocation
* At one time, I'm shocked to notice that I can hardly  see anything, through the heavy fog

* It emitted untreated polluted air, straight into the surroundings.
* Seeing my hometown suffer from pollution was disheartening and frustrating. It made me more conscious of environmental issues
* environment is compromised/sacrificed to economic development
* at the cost of the 
### Trip to Xinjiang
* With some of my colleagues and friends, 5 in total, just enough to fill a car
* Car journey: We drove all the way from Urumqi to Yili, which is on the border of Xinjiang. Long hours in the car made us all exhausted both mentally and physically. Luckily we had shifts, so we each get to have a break.
* The hardship was totally worth it, as we not only get to **experience exotic landscapes and culture**, but also had to chance to try local food, which can't be seen in Hangzhou.

### Sport

* watch 
* water sports
#### Kayaking
* my colleague used to offer Kayaking classes, it was like very popular, so I never get the chance to register. I occasionally see them kayaking in the river
* What it is like: It requires paddling through water in a narrow boat.
* Why want: It's a physical challenge which keeps me fit. I know this sport is tiring. Also, I'm afraid of the water. Fosters collaboration and team work.
* Why watch: The game can be quite exciting to watch, for the competition and strategy shown by players. The suspense of competition often continues until the end.

### Experience 
#### Bad Service
* indifference, impatience
* At an Italian restaurant where I had planned to take my then-girlfriend on our first date. It was two years ago and we were both excited about the night.
* Once seated, the waiter took a long time to take our orders, despite the restaurant not being particularly busy.
* When our food finally arrived, I was in huge shock. I love Italian food and know how to cook some dishes myself, but the Carbonara presented to me was the worst I even seen. **Salty**, burnt **and** raw at the same time. Also, my pasta was lukewarm.
* We don't leave plenty of time for the problem to be solved, as we immediately paid our bill and left with disappointment. 
* ruined my day
* I will never enter that restaurant again, I swear to god.

#### With a young child
* an occasion when I spent time with a young child. 
* This happened at my colleague's son's birthday party. I decided to bring a guitar as a gift, knowing the child's interest in music.
* We ended up spending the entire afternoon together, where I taught him some basic guitar chords and picking technique.
* By the end of the day, he was able to strum a few simple songs including twinkle twinkle little star. Seeing his sense of achievement and the joy on his face was truly rewarding. 
* **Not only did he feel satisfied, I also experience a great sense of fulfillment by teaching others,  sparking a new passion in a young mind.**
#### Meals
One of the most unusual meals I've ever had holds significant meaning to me. I can't recall the exact date, but it was approximately three years ago, **shortly after my college graduation**. It happened on a Friday night when my then-girlfriend took me to a local Italian restaurant. 

Up until that point, I had never ventured into the realm of exotic cuisines, so **this encounter with Italian food** marked a **novel** experience for me. I was captivated by the rich flavors and unique ingredients that characterized the dishes in this restaurant. I **particularly enjoyed** the Margherita pizza and Carbonara; they remain my favorites to this day.

What made this meal unusual, and indeed transformative, was that **it opened the door for me to explore cooking on my own**. This dining experience ignited a culinary curiosity in me that I had not known before, and it continues to influence my food choices and cooking ventures.
#### Speech
* music about surf rock

#### Learn ｜ Play in a band

* After graduating
* Despite all these obstacles
* By relying on self-confident, perseverance, one can achieve anything
I used to play notes mechanically, like a machine without anything original.
With platforms like Youtube, which provide numerous valuable lessons on music theory, I can learn it online, without having to go to traditional music schools.

However, it's **challenging** as it demands hard work and continuous effort 坚持努力.


It's all about perseverance.

#### Ads don't like
I really enjoy watching advertisements, as some are very creative and attractive. 
However, there is one advertisement I dislike that I’ve seen on television about a toilet cleaner. A celebrity visit randomly picked homes and asks the owner if the toilet is clean or not. Everyone replies that their toilets are clean, but then the celebrity zooms in with their camera and reveals some dirt. They proceed to clean the toilet with a new liquid, making it sparkle.
Seeing this ad during mealtime is disgusting and annoying, sometimes even making me feel nauseous.

* on the way to a local music festival with my friend
* We take a cab to the location described on the ticket, but it was a deserted place of power plant
* Unable to find on the map, so we had to walk aimlessly, hoping to find someone to help
* Luckily, it was close to the actual location. We managed to get close step by step, by following the sound made by amplifiers.
* Although I was pretty frustrated and annoyed by the false information provided by the organizer, but finally found it by ourselves has solved the problem

#### Invention
