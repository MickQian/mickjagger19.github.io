He never seems annoyed or refuse to help, 

Thanks to his help, we managed to produce our original song and perform in local concerns, which turned out to be quite successful.

### Job

One job I find particularly interesting is being a guitarist in a band. I always dream myself as Eric Clapton, although I can never be as good as the guitar God. Anyway, this role not only requires sophisticated guitar-playing skills but also involves music composition, which requires a thorough understanding of music history.

### Public Figure
* successful
* popular

I'like to talk about a legendary figure in the music world, David Bowie, who is widely recognized for his distinctive voice, eclectic musical style, and innovative approach to artistry. He's an intriguing character because of his constant reinvention and his ability to blend various musical genres, including rock, pop, electronic, and experimental music.

Bowie's popularity stems from his unique persona and his groundbreaking music. He created numerous iconic albums like "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" and "Heroes", which have influenced countless musicians and left a lasting impact on the music industry. His alter ego, Ziggy Stardust, a flamboyant and androgynous extraterrestrial being, challenged societal norms and contributed to his fame.

What made Bowie particularly helpful was his openness to change and his courage to push boundaries. He was unafraid to experiment with different styles and personas, opening the door for future artists to explore their identities and creativity without fear of judgment. His influence extends beyond music to fashion, film, and visual art, making him an enduring cultural icon. David Bowie's legacy continues to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide.

### Clothes

* a new guitar flagship shop, **featuring** my favorite guitar brand
* It sells a variety of guitars, as well as related accessories including guitar amp, pick, string and straps
* Based on my observation there, most of the customers are musicians or guitar players. They came for better guitars or back-up ones. Random walkers will occasionally come in, out of curiosity.
* With the rising of music industry and growing level of musical aesthetics, I believe more and more people will have their own guitars, making this shop thrive in business
### Trip to Xinjiang
* With some of my colleagues and friends, 5 in total, just enough to fill a car
* Car journey: We drove all the way from Urumqi to Yili, which is on the border of Xinjiang. Long hours in the car made us all exhausted both mentally and physically. Luckily we had shifts, so we each get to have a break.

### Experience 

#### Bad Service
* At an Italian restaurant where I had planned to take my then-girlfriend on our first date. It was two years ago and we were both excited about the night.
 *  Once seated, the waiter took a long time to take our orders, despite the restaurant not being particularly busy.
* When our food finally arrived, I was in huge shock. I love Italian food and know how to cook some dishes myself, but the carbonara presented to me was the worst I even seen. Salty, burnt and raw at the same time. Also, my pasta was lukewarm
* We don't leave plenty of time for the problem to be solved, as we immediately paid our bill and left with disappointment.
* I will never enter that restaurant again, I swear to god.

#### With a young child
* an occasion when I spent time with a young child. 
* This happened at my colleague's son's birthday party. I decided to bring a guitar as a gift, knowing the child's interest in music.
* We ended up spending the entire afternoon together, where I taught him some basic guitar chords and picking technique.
* By the end of the day, he was able to strum a few simple songs including twinkle twinkle little star. Seeing his sense of achievement and the joy on his face was truly rewarding. 
* **Not only did he feel satisfied, I also experience a great sense of fulfillment by teaching others,  sparking a new passion in a young mind.**
#### Meals
One of the most unusual meals I've ever had holds significant meaning to me. I can't recall the exact date, but it was approximately three years ago, **shortly after my college graduation**. It happened on a Friday night when my then-girlfriend took me to a local Italian restaurant. 

Up until that point, I had never ventured into the realm of exotic cuisines, so **this encounter with Italian food** marked a **novel** experience for me. I was captivated by the rich flavors and unique ingredients that characterized the dishes in this restaurant. I **particularly enjoyed** the Margherita pizza and Carbonara; they remain my favorites to this day.

What made this meal unusual, and indeed transformative, was that it opened the door for me to explore cooking on my own. This dining experience ignited a culinary curiosity in me that I had not known before, and it continues to influence my food choices and cooking ventures.
#### Speech
* music about surf rock
* second year of college, in a school club
* prepare keynote, videos
* not so many people, but satisfied, self-expression

#### Learn 
I used to play notes mechanically, like a machine without anything original.
With platforms like Youtube, which provide numerous valuable lessons on music theory, I can learn it online, without having to go to traditional music schools.

However, it's **challenging** as it demands hard work and continuous effort 坚持努力.
It's all about perseverance. 

#### Pollution
* during a visit to my hometown 2 years ago, when I was on a vocation
* At one time, I'm shocked to notice that I can hardly  see anything, through the heavy fog
* I looked for the source of this through difficulty, and suddenly some chimneys came into my sight. I suddenly realized that it's power plant that is producing this polluted air.
* It emitted untreated polluted air, straight into the surroundings.
* Seeing my hometown suffer from pollution was disheartening and frustrating. It made me more conscious of environmental issues
