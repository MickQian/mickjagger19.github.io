#### Party 

#### Music & band
I'd like to talk about my friend, Eric, who I met during a band audition. Eric was applying for the guitarist position then, and his passion for music have a profound impression on me.

Besides the fact that he's a fantastic musician, he's also a person with **great charm and charisma.** 
#### Work
He's also devoted to work, leading a team on AI music generation and has gained reputation in that area. I guess all that achievements come from his exceptional communication skills, which makes working with him an exciting and rewarding experience.

#### Interest
Moreover, we quickly discovered we both love Italian cuisine so we often **gather at a nearby  Italian restaurant**,  after rehearsal, discussing everything from music to life. 

#### Interesting idea
* During rehearsals, he **constantly** brought unique ideas to the table, whether it was about the song's design, or subtle suggestions about the tone of the guitar. 
* Once during a rehearsal, the bassist accidentally kick down the chair near her, making a high-pitched sound. While most of us ignored it, he immediately captured this, suggested integrating that note into the song, which turned out to be surprisingly weird but somehow melodic and harmonious. The **melody** and the **groove** of the song is **enriched** by this **genius design**. We were all convinced with his talents in music.
* Moreover, he even **offered insights** into our **stage design**, suggesting specific movements and poses for us when performing. All of these ideas sound interesting and inspiring.

#### Help others
As an inexperienced amateur band, we often encounter numerous problems, involving equipments, effects, skills or music transcription. Since he's a **semi-professional** player, he always managed to solve our problems within seconds. 
* Once before a performance, the bassist accidentally got a flu, and was unable to give a performance. Though at that time he had heavy work to do, but he offered to help even though  that meant he had to work overtime. He not only attended all the emergent rehearsals, but also practiced in his spare time.

Thanks to his help, we managed to produce our original song and perform in local concerns, which turned out to be quite successful.
#### Happy Photos
* So I was in a local band, of a local company, and all of the band members are colleagues.
* And about 3 months ago, as a band from the local company, we were told that we were provided an opportunity to perform in front of a **massive audience**, to celebrate the upcoming Olympics.
* As we are all inexperienced amateur musicians, this news not only surprised us, but also got us very nervous. We definitely wanted to **grasp the opportunity**, and also needed to practice more.
* So we started to rehearse 2 or 3 times a week, improving every possible aspects of our performance.
* At the night we delivered the performance, before we went on stage, we took a brief photo of ourselves. The composition of photo is quite simple: A photo of all our band members, standing in front of a huge logo of that concert, but the story behind it had already **left an indelible imprint in my mind**, which I truly treasured.

#### Move to community
* About a fortnight ago
* When I was helping him moving, I saw his new place. Compact, clean space. **Decorated in Scandinavian style**, just like those in the Black Mirror.
* Everything is highly digitalized, suitable for tech-geeks to live in
* At that night, he invited us to have a party, where we enjoyed some soothing bossa nova, and had a great dinner made by himself, which was Italian and quite tasty, I would say
* He quickly integrated into our group with his humor and warm heart. We were happy to accept him as our new neighbor

* The Graduate:

	* **Dustin Hoffman** plays Benjamin brilliantly, with his portrayal of **youthful confusion** and disillusionment 醒悟.
	* Explores the themes of generation gap and identity/existential crisis. 
	* Added to this was a **haunting musical score**, written by my favorite folk duo, Simon & Garfunkel.  The music is already good enough for itself, but also integrated into the plots so well, especially the one with Benjamin's infamous poolside drifting scene.
	* In essence, "The Graduate," with its **compelling story architecture** and **iconic soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel**, remains a timeless masterpiece. 
	* ==***As much as it's entertaining, it's also educational and deeply thought-provoking.***==

#### Foreigner speaking fluent Chinese | Different Culture
* During a band audition, applying for the Guitarist/Vocal 
* After a brief **introduction** in fluent English, We knew he was transferred to China to work here for several weeks. He originally worked in Finland, a **nordic** country I suppose.
* However, as he started to sing, he changed to Chinese. I believe it's the most fluent Chinese I've heard coming out of a foreigner's mouth, including those on TV.
* As we were in a shock, he explained that he had always been a **fan** of Chinese culture, and had **taught** himself Chinese.

* He started his business as the former president of Y Combinator which is a **startup accelerator**.
* Apart from YC, he had some other successful projects too, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Strip. It showed his **exceptional** talent of ==**identifying** and **nurturing** these concepts.==
* And finally, he founded OpenAI,  where he guided cutting-edge research in AI. **We all know the rest of the story.**
* Altman truly ==**embodies success in the business world**==.  Someone would call him the father of GPT, but I think that **credit** goes to those scientist. However, it embodied the role he played in this huge AI wave and how successful he is.


### Movies that disappoint

Once upon a time in Hollywood
* already a big fan, was expecting the film to be as good as Pulp fiction, at least the reservoir dog
* I found the plots cheesy, cliche, and kind of boring 
* performance of learnardo and brad pitt is not satisfying, unworthy of their fames
* Some might say the film was Ok compared to other theatrical movies, but I've put very hight expectations into that one, So I' was really disappointed
### Job

#### Skills
One job I find particularly interesting is being a guitarist in a band. I always dream about being on the stage as Eric Clapton, **although I know clearly I can never be as good as** the guitar God. **Anyway**, this role not only requires sophisticated guitar-playing skills but also involves music composition, which requires a thorough understanding of music history.

I would like to talk about a night bar/Mexican restaurant near my college. It was **a local landmark**  地标 actually, located on the street next to our campus. People would go there to **relieve stress and anxiety from school**, or celebrate the end of a season. But my last visit there proved me wrong.

Before my friend and I entered the bar, I could already hear the loud sound from the stereos which played **the catchy and cheesy music**. **The tone quality** was rather awful so all I heard was **high pitch of sound** rather than nice and **gentle melodies**.  Besides, after sitting down at a small table, there are too many people talking in a loud voice that I can hardly here my friend was saying. 

Though the food there was tasty, I love the Fajita and Mojito, the atmosphere in the bar **was too awful to endure**. I was expecting a quiet listening experience but everything was out of my imagination. **People were raising their voice as the background music was overwhelming**, which made the place all the more **unbearable**.

* Once seated, the waiter **took a long time** to take our orders, despite the restaurant not being particularly busy.
* When our food finally arrived, I was in huge shock. I love Italian food and know how to cook some dishes myself, but the Carbonara presented to me was the worst I even seen. I don't know how they managed to make that dish **salty**, **burnt** and raw at the same time. Also, my risotto was lukewarm, I can't even swallow. Even If I complained about it to the manager, they seemed  **indifference** and **impatience**

* Instead of regular birthday activities, we ended up spending the entire afternoon together with a kind of impromptu guitar class, where I taught him some basic guitar chords and picking technique. Actually I was quite nervous, since I was merely an inexperienced amateur guitar newbie myself.
* By the end of the day, he was able to strum a few simple songs including twinkle twinkle little star. Seeing his sense of achievement and the joy on his face was truly rewarding. 
* Based on the joy on his face, more than just giving him a gift, I was able to pass my obsession towards music to another,  ignite within him a passion for music. **Not only did he feel satisfied, I also experience a great sense of fulfillment from teaching, which leads to my obsession toward music till today**. It's **gratifying** to witness someone's progress.

#### Meals
One of the most unusual meals I've ever had holds significant meaning to me. I can't recall the exact date, but it was approximately three years ago, **shortly after my college graduation**. It happened on a Friday night when my then-girlfriend took me to a local Italian restaurant. 

Up until that point, I had never ventured into the realm of exotic cuisines, so **this encounter with Italian food** marked a **novel** experience for me. I was captivated by the rich flavors and unique ingredients that characterized the dishes in this restaurant. I **particularly enjoyed** the Margherita pizza and Carbonara; they remain my favorites to this day.

What made this meal unusual, and indeed transformative, was that **it opened the door for me to explore cooking on my own**. This dining experience ignited a culinary curiosity in me that I had not known before, and it continues to influence my food choices and cooking ventures.
#### Speech
* music about surf rock

#### Ads don't like
I really enjoy watching advertisements, as some are very creative and attractive. 
However, there is one advertisement I dislike that I’ve seen on television about a toilet cleaner. 
A celebrity visit randomly picked homes and asks the owner if the toilet is clean or not. **Everyone** replies that their toilets are clean, but then the celebrity **zooms** in with their camera and **reveals** some dirt. They **proceed** to clean the toilet with a new **liquid**, making it **sparkle**.
Seeing this ad during mealtime is **disgusting** and **annoying**, sometimes even making me feel nauseous.

cheesy

#### Useful ad
To be honest, I don’t watch a lot of television/ if I'm honest,  but I do watch some TV episodes on Stream Media. 
I remember one time I was watching a  popular music TV show, and it's basically several bands competing with each others. In the middle of the show, an ad **popped out**. Now usually, I would be annoyed by ads, but it was about an electric guitar. I saw a musician playing **beautiful notes** with this guitar, and it **haunted** me throughout the rest of the show. And I was not aware of what happened in that show.
After the commercial ended, I immediately bought one on online shop. And I was happy and satistied about the guitar. Throughout the time, it has totally proved that it **worth the price**, and looking back,  I'm thankful for that encounter with the ad.


#### Lost | False information
* It happened several months ago when my friend and I are on the way to a local music festival
* The concerted was supposed to start in the afternoon, so we took a cab to the location described **on the ticket** at noon, but it was a deserted place which turned out to be a used power plant
* Unable to find on the map, so we had to walk **aimlessly**, hoping to find someone to help
* Luckily, it was close to the actual location. We managed to get close step by step, by following the sound made by stereos.
* Although I was pretty **frustrated** and **annoyed** by the false information provided by the organizer, but finally found it by ourselves has solved the problem


#### Advice | Proud
* So about 3 years ago, my company is holding a competition called "Hackathon". It's basically a group of people gathering together, solving an issue within 48 hours or so. Later, all the work will be **evaluated** by some judges.
* Some of my colleagues call out me to join their team. Why not?
* But we encountered countless issues, as we had no experience participating in any hackathon before. One of the major problem was, we found ourselves working on **separated** computers, so **information sharing** was a struggle. I immediately suggested we started the "**collaborated development**" feature on our computers. As a result, the efficient was doubled.
* After working **tirelessly** on the issue for several days, We were thrilled and overwhelmed to **receive** an honorable mention for that competition, for the competition had been fierce. 
* Looking back, we were proud that we managed to solve a problem **outside our area of expertise** and the perseverance we had put in.



#### Invention
* AirPods, which is a bluetooth headphone
* It's a headphone/noise isolator
* I love it for its convenience, without the bothering of the line.
* Also, as a music lover, the denoise feature ensure me enjoying music in a undisturbed way, disconnecting me from the noise.
* Pretty easy to use, you just put the headphones on the ears, than they will be automatically connected with apple devices



Looking back, I think it reflects the different mindsets of the young generation and their parents in China.
It's probably due to the hardships the parents experienced in the past.
They should enjoy life like, a bit, after working hard

#### Art
**The piece of work that I like the most is** "The Starry Night" by brilliant Vincent Van Gogh. 

Among the countless pieces of art that have been created **over centuries**, one painting that has always **captivated** me is “The Starry Night” by Vincent van Gogh.

I first encountered “The Starry Night” during a school trip to a local [Museum](https://ieltsrewind.com/describe-a-museum-you-have-visited-and-liked/) , where a replica is being exhibited.

I had to say, its **vibrant colors and unique style** stood out among the other artworks.
from the later research I did, Painted in 1889 in a mental hospital, it **presents an image** of a night sky filled with **swirling** stars, overlooking a quaint 古色古香 town. The night sky could be seen as a representation of his inner feelings and emotional state at that time. 
![[Pasted image 20230930103128.png]]


In fact, not only did I enjoy the painting itself,  **I also adore** a beautiful song called "Vincent"by Don Mclean too. Its lyric starts with "Starry Starry night", serves as a tribute to Van Gogh.


Resonate & dark times & adversity: I find most fascinating about “The Starry Night” is how it resonates with me on an emotional level. It serves as a **reminder** that **beauty can be found even in dark times**, and that ==creativity can flourish **amidst adversity 逆境**==.

It serves as an inspiration, **reminding** us of the power of perseverance and the unlimited potential of human [creativity](https://ieltsrewind.com/describe-a-creative-person-whose-work-you-admire/).

#### Feeling
* drawback: some companies mislead consumers by presenting some features that don't exist

#### Online
* annoying, disrupting the experience
* 
#### Celebrity endorsement
* fans consider them as role models, purchase the product based on trust

#### Online ads vs newspaper
Nowadays, online media is much more prevalent than newspaper, the traditional media. Every time people open an app, watching a video or reading an article, ads can be there, which is good exposure.

### Party 



#### when we don't know anyone
I find it totally fine if we don't know anymore, because that's not the purpose of parties. Party is a time for us to relax and enjoy, not some kind of social activity.

#### Uninvited rude?
* It can be rude, depending on the party organizer


#### Uninvited guests, negative intentions


#### Should you go to the party if you only know one person?  





### Festival | History Place

#### Traditional
* provides them a deep **understanding** of their cultural and heritage. For example, during Chinese New year, kids learn about the traditions like red envelopes and eating dumplings.
* And people can learn from the lessons and mistakes have been made from the past, thus avoid making mistakes
* **foster** respect and appreciation **for** other cultures
* These festivals are often rich with history and values, which can be educational and inspiring for children, and is a good way to entertain

I think it's a **heartwarming** experience for kids to **learn about the stories and symbols behind the festivals.**


#### History taught in primary school
main difference: level of detail and complexity.
primary: with a focus on helping students understand the basic concepts
high school: taught in more depth, understand **perspectives**, **examining the causes and consequences of historical events**.


#### Protect
do want to protect and preserve except maybe a few who **put business ahead of their morality and rational thinking**

We had our moments when people spontaneously protested the plan to demolish such sites in the past.

#### Is it hard to protect


* **natural wear and tear** that occurs **over time**, which can lead to deterioration and unrepairable damage
* balancing the need for preservation with the need for modernization and development. For example, there may be pressure from developers or local authorities to **demolish** or **alter** historical buildings in order to make way for **new infrastructure or buildings**

#### How to learn 

* they can always learn history from school, which is a mandatory course that every should provide

* by holding events, people gather together so that they can share joy and create lasting memories
* history is preserved and kept down

#### Disappearing?

While they have faced some challenges, I wouldn't say they are disappearing. In fact, I think the term "revolutionized" is more appropriate.

Yes, there’s no denying that modernization and changing lifestyles have had an impact on traditional festivals. 

However, people are now celebrating festival through new ways. For example, posting about festival in social media.

So basically, it's the way of the celebration that is changing, not the festivals themselves.

#### Music
Absolutely, music plays a pivotal role in traditional festivals. 
* enhances the festival atmosphere 
* often **carries** significant cultural symbolism. Several tunes pop into my mind whenever I think about New Year, and that's the power of music

Some children may find certain aspects of festivals overwhelming or scary.
For instance, some children might dislike Halloween because they find the costumes and decorations frightening

### Tech


#### What technology do people currently use?
* traditional digital devices, smartphones, laptops, TVs
* wearable: smartwatches, augmented-reality glasses
* As for information technology, there are software technology and Machine Learning


#### Big companies release new products 
The main reason is to attract customer's attention to encourage them to purchase
Another reason is that, in today's highly competitive market, need to ... to gain an advantage over their rivals.

#### A good thing?
It depends on how the tech is being used
* If used properly, such as smartphones and laptops, the geographical boundaries can be broken, the productivity can also be significantly enhanced
* However, uncontrolled use of tech can lead to job displacement and unemployment, creating more society issues


#### Limit screen time
* encourage children to engage in more outdoor activities 
* set a role model by managing their own screen time, which seems very hard



### Parks

#### Do young people like to go?
From what I've observed, though young people would love to spend some time in the park, (you know), get close to nature, the rapid pace  of modern work life wouldn't allow them to do so. They get off late, and are only available on weekends, and they'd rather spending them at home.


* jogging
* bird-watching, dog-walking, taichi
* Some may choose less tensive activities : chessing, reading, dancing 


#### Is making noise one of people's rights?
While making sound is a right, it must be balanced with others' rights to peace and quiet, especially in shared spaces.

* Environmentally, reduce pollution, provide habitats for wildlife, improve air quality 
* provide recreational space, I know central park is a great place for enjoying music, for several people would gather together to remember John Lennon


### Opinions 

#### Old ideas from books?

Indeed, there are some ideas that are considered as  "old" or out of styles from previous books. However, there are also timeless principles hidden.


#### When do you think children start to have their own opinions?
Children begin forming opinions around age 4-5, when they start understanding the world around them. However, these opinions become more complex and independent during adolescence, as they gain more experience and knowledge.

#### Are children's opinions influenced by their parents? (The behavior and the language of parents will significantly affect their children's opinions as they are the main source of influence in their children's growing environment.)
Absolutely, parents significantly shape their children's perspectives. They're the primary influence during early years, shaping their worldview, values, and beliefs through their actions and language.

#### Who are smart children likely to be influenced by?
Smart children are likely to be influenced by a variety of sources, including **parents**, **teachers**, and **peers**. They also tend to be influenced by their own curiosity and independent research.

#### What kind of people have lots of great ideas in your country? (Innovative people in my country usually come from professions related to computers, media and science. The nature of their jobs drives them to come up with innovative ideas and it is the only way for them to thrive. )
Innovative thinkers, often found **in fields like** technology, science, and arts, typically have many great ideas. Entrepreneurs and educators also contribute significantly with their creative solutions and approaches.

People these days are all about green living and **reducing their carbon footprint.**


_Factories use_ **_fossil fuels_** _to run machines and the **_carbon monoxide_** _released lead to air pollution. 
Factories_ **_dispose_** _of their waste in nearby_ **_waterways_**_, creating water pollution._
