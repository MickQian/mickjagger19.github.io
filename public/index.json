In China, most people enjoy fishing as a relaxing activity.\nFood It\u0026rsquo;s highly nutritious, containing a lot of protein and unsaturated fat.\nMany fish around you For example, I’ve visited aquariums many times and diving in areas with diverse marine life.\nBut since I have a strong fear of sea, I don\u0026rsquo;t like the feeling of surrounded by a lot of fishes.\nMusic catchy, memorable tunes uplift my spirit, recharge my battery and energy exuberant fall under the classification of blues rock\nmaintaining a positive state of mind\nWhat I really enjoy the most is bossa nova. No sooner do I start listening to it than I get really obsessed about it/\nDream Why His sophisticated guitar playing skills and outstanding composition abilities admires me. I wish I was the fourth member of Cream.\nDrinks Do people like tea and coffee nowadays? Well, I would say that the love for tea and coffee is still going strong these days.\nI usually go with coffee because most of my guests prefer it over tea. I like to have a variety of coffees available to cater to different tastes\nI don\u0026rsquo;t buy drinks on a regular basis. Whenever I see some drinks and I feel like drinking, I\u0026rsquo;ll grab some.\nSpace Have you ever learnt about outer spaces and stars? Yes, I learned about those things in High School, when I was taught Astronomy. I learned about solar system, different nebulas and galaxies. Out of curiosity, I watched 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it has been one of my favorite movies till this day.\nDo you like science fiction movies? Absolutely, I enjoy science fiction movies. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of David Kubrick, and his movies like 2001: Space Odyssey. Also, my favorite TV episode is Black Mirror, which gives me an insight into the future. One of the episode that most impressed me is about a programmer creating an imaginary spaceship based on a computer program.\nDo you want to know more about outer space? Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;m always eager to learn more about outer space. It\u0026rsquo;s a realm full of endless wonders and discoveries.\nTravel to space Oh wow, I have never thought about it. First thing to do is definitely record everything I see with a proper sports camera. If I have the chance, I would like to see the dark side of the like for every Pink Floyd fan. Also, trying to find aliens on Mars sounds fun.\nGifts Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others? Yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve made and sent origami gifts. It\u0026rsquo;s a thoughtful, personal touch that people seem to appreciate.\nWhat do you consider when choosing a gift? I consider the recipient\u0026rsquo;s personal interests, the gift\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness, its quality, and my budget.\nDo you think you are good at choosing gifts? I believe so. I put thought into understanding the recipient\u0026rsquo;s preferences, which helps me choose meaningful gifts.\nChocolate as gifts No. While chocolate as a gift can make nice, I find it a little bit cliche, as it\u0026rsquo;s so common a choice.\n==I find it better to personalize the gifts according to/aligned on the recipient\u0026rsquo;s interests.==\nKey Yes, I always have a bunch of keys with me.\nLost spare key\nHelp Do you?

It was two years ago and we were both excited about the night, I even got some gifts prepared. Once seated, the waiter took a long time to take our orders, despite the restaurant not being particularly busy. When our food finally arrived, I was in huge shock. I love Italian food and know how to cook some dishes myself, but the Carbonara presented to me was the worst I even seen. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how they managed to make that dish salty, burnt and raw at the same time. What\u0026rsquo;s worse, my risotto was lukewarm, I can\u0026rsquo;t even swallow. Even If I complained about it to the manager, they seemed indifference and impatience,so we immediately paid our bill and left with disappointment. Dining out is not just about the food, but also about enjoying a relaxing and pleasant experience. We were disappointed and it It has totally ruined my day.

It was regular party with regular party activities, until we ended up spending the entire afternoon together with a kind of impromptu guitar class, where I taught him some basic guitar chords and picking technique. He showed great artistic flair and great sense of music through this. By the end of the day, he was able to strum a few simple songs including twinkle twinkle little star. Seeing such progress, I suggested to have a small live performance at the party, and based on the joy on his face and those audience, I knew I had made something great here. It\u0026rsquo;s not just about giving a gift, it was about sparking passion towards music in a young mind.

I can\u0026rsquo;t recall the exact date, but it was approximately three years ago, shortly after my college graduation. It happened on a Friday night when my then-girlfriend took me to a local Italian restaurant.\nUp until that point, I had never ventured into the realm of exotic cuisines, so this encounter with Italian food marked a novel experience for me. I was captivated by the rich flavors and unique ingredients that characterized the dishes in this restaurant. I particularly enjoyed the Margherita pizza and Carbonara; they remain my favorites to this day.\nWhat made this meal unusual, and indeed transformative, was that it opened the door for me to explore cooking on my own.

Some thoughts are truly timeless. For example, Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of force has never fallen out of fashion or lost its relevance since its publication.\nGame played As a child, I haven\u0026rsquo;t participated in many games. However, I can recall vividly about roller-skating in the playground of my community\nSpeaking of roller-skating, it\u0026rsquo;s basically skating, but on the cement roads. Also, it requires special equipment/appliance, too. Usually, after dinner, some of my friends and I would gather at the playground, skating in circle. Sometimes we would had a informal competition, the first one to complete certain laps would be the Champion. Sometimes we slipped and hurt our knees, so later we had our kneecap on. Though I was really good at it, as I was a little afraid of skating at a high speed, I really enjoyed the happiness and tension from this game.

At first I thought It would be easy. I mean, what\u0026rsquo;s so hard about recording a video? But the reality proved me wrong. Unfortunately, several problems occurred. I find it hard to switch mode, fix and lost some part. Also, the videos it recorded are separated into small pieces, because of the memory limit I think I won\u0026rsquo;t use any sports camera currently, I\u0026rsquo;ll use smartphones instead Book As many others might have say, the novel I enjoy the most is Harry Potter Harry Potter basically talk about how a boy, Harry Potter grow up with his friends, facing countless challenges, fighting numerous Death Eaters, and finally beat Voldemort, the biggest villain in the book.
