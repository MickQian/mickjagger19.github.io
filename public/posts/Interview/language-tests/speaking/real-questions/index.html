Once during a rehearsal, the bassist/composer accidentally kick down the chair near her, making a high-pitched sound. While most of us ignored it, he immediately captured this, suggested integrating that note into the song, which turned out to be surprisingly weird but somehow melodic and harmonious. I must say, the melody and the groove of the song is enriched by this genius design. We were all convinced with his talents in music. Moreover, he even offered insights into our stage design, suggesting specific movements and poses for us when performing. All of these ideas sound interesting and inspiring.

Though at that time he had heavy work to do, but he offered to substitute even though that meant he had to work overtime. He not only attended all the emergent rehearsals, but also practiced in his spare time. Thanks to his help, we managed to produce our original song and perform in local concerns, which turned out to be quite successful. It’s not just about delivering a performance, it’s about viewing us as a whole team and sacrificing his spare time to make sure we get through hard times.

And about 3 months ago, as a band from the local company, we were told that we were provided an opportunity to perform in front of a massive audience, to celebrate the upcoming Olympics. As we are all inexperienced amateur musicians, this news not only surprised us, but also got us very nervous. We definitely wanted to grasp the opportunity, and also needed to practice more. So we started to rehearse 2 or 3 times a week, improving every possible aspects of our performance. It’s not just about playing or creating music, it’s more about creating cherished moments with who I care and connects with my innerworld. Right before performance, before we went on stage, we took a brief photo of ourselves.

I really admire his ability to immerse himself into diverse characters, from the intellectually brilliant expertise 专家 in “Rain Man” to the confusing college student in “The graduate,”. These performances are truly remarkable/extraordinary/exceptional. He was able to portray the character with nuanced facial expressions and body language, which all contribute to his exceptional acting skills, making him a truly inspirational figure in the world of cinema. The Graduate: critically acclaimed story-telling film The story talks about Benjamin Braddock, fresh out of college and unsure about his future. Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin brilliantly, with his portrayal of youthful confusion and disillusionment 醒悟. Explores the themes of generation gap and identity/existential crisis. Added to this was a haunting musical score, written by my favorite folk duo, Simon \u0026 Garfunkel. The music is already good enough for itself, but also integrated into the plots so well, especially the one with Benjamin’s infamous poolside drifting scene. ==As much as it’s entertaining, it’s also educational and deeply thought-provoking.== ==In essence, “The Graduate,” with its compelling 引人入胜的 story architecture and iconic soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel, remains a timeless masterpiece.== I first watched this film in College, and I spent considerable hours thinking about my future.

<p>Well,  I would say that the love for tea and coffee is still going strong these days.</p>
<p>I usually go with coffee because most of my guests prefer it over tea. I like to have a variety of coffees available to cater to different tastes</p>

<p>Yes, I learned about those things in High School, when I was taught Astronomy. I learned about solar system, different nebulas and galaxies. Out of curiosity, I watched 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it has been one of my favorite movies till this day.</p>

<p>Absolutely, I enjoy science fiction movies. I&rsquo;m a big fan of David Kubrick, and his movies like 2001: Space Odyssey. Also, my favorite TV episode is Black Mirror, which gives me an insight into the future. One of the episode that most impressed me is about a <strong>programmer</strong> creating an imaginary spaceship based on a computer program.</p>

It was a time of great <strong>turmoil</strong>, with the whole <strong>region</strong> separated into power struggle between 3 kingdoms, Wei, Shu and Wu.</p>
<p>The <strong>stories</strong> of the <strong>strategy</strong>, and the <strong>political</strong> intrigue/<strong>drama</strong> happened in that period has contributed to this epic novel called &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo;, which is a must-read, classic <strong>literacy</strong> work for students in China. It also had <strong>profound</strong> implications on the Chinese literature landscape, inspiring countless writers in <strong>subsequent generations.</strong></p>

Luckily, with his help, our project has yield some pretty <strong>impressive results</strong> in a short time,  sometimes even approaching the level of project from those large technology companies like Google.</p>

<li>Once during a rehearsal, the bassist/composer accidentally kick down the chair near her, making a <strong>high-pitched</strong> sound. While most of us <strong>ignored</strong> it, he immediately captured this, suggested <strong>integrating</strong> that note into the song, which turned out to be surprisingly weird but somehow melodic and harmonious.

<li>So I was in a local band, of a local company, and all of the band members are colleagues.</li>
<li>And about 3 months ago, as a band from the local company, we were told that we were provided an opportunity to perform in front of a <strong>massive audience</strong>, to celebrate the upcoming Olympics.</li>
<li>As we are all inexperienced amateur musicians, this news not only surprised us, but also got us very nervous. We definitely wanted to <strong>grasp the opportunity</strong>, and also needed to practice more.</li>
<li>So we started to rehearse 2 or 3 times a week, <strong>improving</strong> every possible aspects of our performance.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not just about playing or creating music, it&rsquo;s more about creating cherished moments with who I care and connects with my innerworld.</li>
<li>Right before performance, before we went on stage, we took a brief photo of ourselves. The composition of photo is quite simple: A photo of all our band members, standing in front of a huge logo of that concert, ==but the story behind it had already <strong>left an indelible imprint in my mind</strong>, which I truly cherished.==</li>

<li>Everything is highly digitalized, <strong>equipped</strong> with SOTA <strong>screens</strong>, stereo, <strong>creating</strong> a perfect movie watching and music-enjoying experience,  suitable for tech-geeks to live in</li>
<li>At that night, he invited us to have a party, where we enjoyed some soothing bossa nova, and had a great dinner made by himself, which was Italian and quite tasty, I would say</li>
<li>He quickly integrated into our group with his humor and warm heart. We were happy to accept him as our new neighbor</li>
<li>In the bushes near my apartment, there are many stray cats. He has been taking care of them since he moved in. I can often spot him feeding them early in the morning, and he even provides them with shelter, which will cost a fortune.</li>
<li>It was because of his kind action and love towards wildlives, that make our community a better and more united place to live in</li>

<p>Dustin Hoffman</p>
<p>Dustin Hoffman is an actor I greatly admire for his remarkable <strong>versatility</strong> and depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>He&rsquo;s considered to be one of the most talented actors, along with Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson</li>
<li>He has <strong>starred in countless</strong> story-telling films and documentaries, and &ldquo;The graduate&rdquo; is one of my favorite films, which explores the theme of generation gap and identity crisis.</li>
<li>I really admire his ability to <strong>immerse</strong> himself into <strong>diverse</strong> characters, from the intellectually brilliant expertise 专家 in &ldquo;Rain Man&rdquo; to the confusing college student in &ldquo;The graduate,&rdquo;. These performances are truly remarkable/extraordinary/exceptional.</li>
<li>He was able to <strong>portray</strong> the character with <em>nuanced facial expressions</em> and body language, which all contribute to his exceptional acting skills, making him a truly inspirational figure in the world of cinema.</li>
<li>The Graduate:
<ul>
<li>critically acclaimed story-telling film</li>
<li>The story talks about Benjamin Braddock, <strong>fresh out of</strong> college and <strong>unsure about</strong> his future.</li>
<li><strong>Dustin Hoffman</strong> plays Benjamin brilliantly, with his portrayal of <strong>youthful confusion</strong> and <strong>disillusionment</strong> 醒悟.</li>
<li>Explores the themes of <strong>generation gap</strong> and <strong>identity/existential crisis</strong>.</li>
<li>Added to this was a <strong>haunting musical score</strong>, written by my favorite folk duo, Simon &amp; Garfunkel.  The music is already good enough for itself, but also <strong>integrated</strong> into the plots so well, especially the one with Benjamin&rsquo;s infamous <strong>poolside drifting</strong> scene.</li>
<li>==As much as it&rsquo;s entertaining, it&rsquo;s also educational and deeply thought-provoking.==</li>
<li>==In essence, &ldquo;The Graduate,&rdquo; with its <strong>compelling 引人入胜的 story architecture</strong> and <strong>iconic soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel</strong>, remains a timeless masterpiece.==  I first watched this film in College, and I spent considerable hours thinking about my future.</li>

<li>During a band audition, applying for the Guitarist/Vocal</li>
<li>After a brief <strong>introduction</strong> in fluent English, We knew he was transferred to China to work here for several weeks. He originally worked in Finland, a <strong>nordic</strong> country I suppose.</li>
<li>However, as he started to sing, he changed to Chinese. I believe it&rsquo;s the most fluent Chinese I&rsquo;ve heard coming out of a foreigner&rsquo;s mouth, including those on TV.</li>
<li>As we were in a shock, he explained that he had always been a <strong>fan</strong> of Chinese culture, and had <strong>taught</strong> himself Chinese.</li>
<li><strong>Anyway</strong>, we spent a few months together, happily, and even delivered some performances. We insisted on performing English songs, as nowadays it&rsquo;s harder to find fluent English speaker than Chinese speaker.</li>

<li><strong>all sizzle and no steak.</strong></li>
<li>So it was basically a <strong>crime film</strong> based on real events.</li>
<li>I found the plots <strong>cheesy</strong>, cliche, and kind of boring</li>
<li>Their performances are subpar. His portrayal felt <strong>uninspired</strong> (and lacked depth), sometimes I wondered If I was watching another film</li>
<li>Besides, the director changed the <strong>original ending</strong>, making it a revenge story, making the plots unreasonable to me, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense at all.</li>
<li>Some might say the film was Ok compared to other <strong>theatrical</strong> movies, but I&rsquo;ve put very hight expectations into that one, So I&rsquo; was really disappointed</li>

<li>immensively proud</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the beauty of music. I spent <strong>countless</strong> hours indulging in various genres of music. I even have my own CD <strong>Collections</strong>. But it never occurred to me that I can play those music myself, with my own hands.</li>
<li>After graduating, I discovered that I had more leisure time than before, so I decided to pick up an instrument and learn to play it by myself</li>
<li>Due to long working hours during the day, I don&rsquo;t have the time to attend any music classes. Thanks to the <strong>abundant tutorials</strong> on social media platform such as Youtube, BiliBili, I can learn from guitar masters anytime anywhere I want, without having to attend traditional music schools. <strong>As a result, my guitar skills improved very rapidly.</strong></li>
<li>Despite all these obstacles, Luckily, through lots of practice, I managed to join a local band and play as the lead guitarist. We successfully  produce our original song and perform in local concerns, which turned out to be quite successful.</li>
<li>==Looking back, it&rsquo;s not just a spontaneous and random decision to pick up a certain instrument, but a decision that have profound implications on my personal life==.  I&rsquo;m grateful that I made the decision, It had opened the gate to music for me.

<p>As a big fan of Margaret Howell, my wardrobe mainly features her classic pieces.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m fond of neutral tones, such as blacks, white, brown and gray, which aligns with the tone in Howell&rsquo;s collection. I find these colors low-profile, <strong>versatile</strong> and easy to pair. Besides, the high-quality choice of the material also make it practical and endurable.</p>
<p>==<strong>Furthermore, Howell&rsquo;s clothes allow me to express myself without being confined to traditional gender norms, as they seamlessly blend masculinity and femininity, creating a unisex appeal.</strong>==</p>
<p>==(cultural) norms==
It&rsquo;s the <strong>minimalist</strong>, <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>versatility</strong> of Howell&rsquo;s clothes that attract me.</p>

People would go there to <strong>relieve stress and anxiety from school</strong>, or celebrate the end of a season. But my last visit there proved me wrong.</p>
<p>Before my friend and I entered the bar, I could already hear the loud sound from the stereos which played <strong>the catchy and cheesy music</strong>. <strong>The tone quality</strong> was rather awful so all I heard was ==<strong>high pitch== of sound</strong> rather than nice and <strong>gentle melodies</strong>.  Besides, after sitting down at a small table, there are too many people talking in a loud voice that I can hardly here my friend was saying.</p>

Though the food there was tasty, I love the Fajita and Mojito, the noise level became overwhelming .

<li>I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to explore <strong>many places</strong>, but one <strong>particular</strong> location in my country that has always intrigued me is</li>
<li>Through some documentaries on Xinjiang hosted on TV, I get to gain insights into unique characteristics of this place.</li>
<li>==We visited colorful craft markets which are called Bazzar, and brought back souvenirs for our friends back here in Hangzhou. One of my most memorable experiences was to the Sailimu Lake. It is a little bit off the beaten track but a serene wonderland surrounded by great scenic beauty 美景 and magnificent landscapes 壮丽风景.==</li>
<li>==What&rsquo;s more, I got to immerse myself into exotic culture, different traditions, cuisines and meet diverse people, which all contributed to an enriching and colorful experience==</li>
<li>City:
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s very different from those developed cities in the southeast, you can&rsquo;t see any magnificent modern buildings like skyscrapers there, but all with exotic vibe</li>
<li>Famous for its featured barbecue and sweet fruit, thanks to the huge Temperature difference between day and night</li>

<li>exotic: clothes, food, their markets, fruits</li>
<li>local people being friendly and modesty, hospitable</li>
<li>With some of my colleagues and friends, 5 in total, just enough to fill a car</li>
<li>first flew to Xinjiang, then rent a local car</li>
<li>instruments: unique and delicate, I bought some and play frequently</li>
<li>Car journey: We drove all the way from Urumqi to Yili, which is on the border of Xinjiang. Long hours in the car made us all exhausted both mentally and physically. Luckily we had shifts, so we each get to have a break.</li>
<li>The hardship was totally worth it, as we not only get to <strong>experience exotic landscapes and culture</strong>, but also had to chance to try local food, which can&rsquo;t be seen in Hangzhou.</li>
<li>Adventure:
<ul>
<li>I believe this is a fantastic way to really <strong>experience the vastness and variety of my country</strong> and the diverse cultures.</li>
<li>do what? We would: camp out along the way, sometimes stay in family homes, guest houses and lodges along the way.</li>
<li>When: I would like to do this probably in autumn when the weather is generally good but not too hot. Winter would be a cold time of year to do the trip, and most of the road will be shutdown due to security concerns. and the peak of summer might be way too hot, especially in certain regions.</li>

<li>This happened at my colleague&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s birthday party. As I knew his son was in a perfect ago to start playing an instrument, I decided to bring a carefully-selected acoustic guitar as a gift, which was a bit expensive.</li>
<li>It was <strong>regular</strong> party with <strong>regular</strong> party activities, until we ended up spending the entire afternoon together with a kind of <strong>impromptu</strong> guitar class, where I taught him some basic guitar chords and picking technique. He showed great <strong>artistic flair</strong> and great sense of music through this.</li>
<li>By the end of the day, he was able to strum a few simple songs including twinkle twinkle little star. Seeing such progress, I suggested to have a small live performance at the party, and based on the joy on his face and those audience, I knew I had made something great here.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not just about giving a gift, it was about sparking passion towards music in a young mind. <strong>Not only did he feel satisfied, I also experience a great sense of fulfillment from teaching, which leads to my obsession toward music till today</strong>.

<p>One of the most unusual meals I&rsquo;ve ever had holds significant meaning to me. I can&rsquo;t recall the exact date, but it was approximately three years ago, <strong>shortly after my college graduation</strong>. It happened on a Friday night when my then-girlfriend took me to a local Italian restaurant.</p>
<p>Up until that point, I had never ventured into the realm of exotic cuisines, so <strong>this encounter with Italian food</strong> marked a <strong>novel</strong> experience for me. I was captivated by the rich flavors and unique ingredients that characterized the dishes in this restaurant. I <strong>particularly enjoyed</strong> the Margherita pizza and Carbonara; they remain my favorites to this day.</p>
<p>What made this meal unusual, and indeed transformative, was that <strong>it opened the door for me to explore cooking on my own</strong>. This dining experience ignited a culinary curiosity in me that I had not known before, and it continues to influence my food choices and cooking ventures.</p>

<li>Usually, after dinner, some of my friends and I would gather at the playground, skating in circle. Sometimes we would had a informal competition, the first one to complete certain laps would be the Champion. Sometimes we slipped and hurt our knees, so later we had our kneecap on.</li>

<p>I really enjoy watching advertisements, as some are very creative and attractive.
However, there is one advertisement I dislike that I’ve seen on television about a toilet cleaner.
A celebrity visit randomly picked homes and asks the owner if the toilet is clean or not. <strong>Everyone</strong> replies that their toilets are clean, but then the celebrity <strong>zooms</strong> in with their camera and <strong>reveals</strong> some dirt. They <strong>proceed</strong> to clean the toilet with a new <strong>liquid</strong>, making it <strong>sparkle</strong>.

<p>To be honest, I don’t watch a lot of television/ if I&rsquo;m honest,  but I do watch some TV episodes on Stream Media.
I remember one time I was watching a  popular music TV show, and it&rsquo;s basically several bands competing with each others. In the middle of the show, an ad <strong>popped out</strong>. Now usually, I would be annoyed by ads, but it was about an electric guitar. I saw a musician playing the most <strong>beautiful notes</strong> I have ever heard with this guitar.
==<strong>I&rsquo;m really into simplicity and minimalistic, so that ad aligned perfectly with my taste.</strong>
and it <strong>haunted</strong> me throughout the rest of the show. And I was not aware of what happened in that show.==
After the commercial ended, I immediately bought one on online shop. And I was happy and satistied about the guitar. Throughout the time, it has totally proved that it <strong>worth the price</strong>, and looking back,  I&rsquo;m thankful for that encounter with the ad.</p>

<li>Some of my colleagues call out me to join their team. Why not?</li>

<p>post-impressionist style
<strong>The piece of work that I like the most is</strong> &ldquo;The Starry Night&rdquo; by brilliant Vincent Van Gogh.</p>
<p>I first encountered “The Starry Night” during a school trip to a local <a href="https://ieltsrewind.com/describe-a-museum-you-have-visited-and-liked/">Museum</a> . Unfortunately, it was merely a replica, but that didn&rsquo;t affect the presentation of that artwork.</p>
<p>As I  wandered in the museum, a painting with its <strong>vibrant colors and unique style</strong> stood out among the other artworks.
So I approached to take a closer look at it.</p>
<p>from the later research I did, painted in 1889 in a mental hospital, it <strong>depicts an image</strong> of a night sky filled with <strong>swirling</strong> &amp; chaotic stars, overlooking a quaint 古色古香 town. The night sky could be seen as a representation of his <strong>inner feelings</strong> and emotional state at that time.
![[Pasted image 20230930103128.png]]</p>
<p><strong>I was also surprised to find that</strong> one of my favorite songs, &ldquo;Vincent&quot;by Don Mclean, starts with the lyric &ldquo;Starry Starry night&rdquo;,  serves as a tribute to Van Gogh.</p>
<p>Resonate &amp; dark times &amp; adversity: I find most fascinating about “The Starry Night” is how it resonates with me on an emotional level. It serves as a <strong>reminder</strong> that ==<strong>beauty can be found even in dark times</strong>==, and that ==creativity can flourish <strong>amidst adversity 逆境</strong>==.</p>
<p>It serves as an inspiration, <strong>reminding</strong> us of the power of perseverance and the unlimited potential of human <a href="https://ieltsrewind.com/describe-a-creative-person-whose-work-you-admire/">creativity</a>.</p>
